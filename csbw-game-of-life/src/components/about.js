            <p>The Game of Life is a cellular automaton invented in 1970 by British mathematician, John Conway.
               It is a "zero-player game" where its evolution is determined by its initial state. It consists of
               a grid of cells that can live, die or multiply based on a set of mathematical rules.
            </p>
